  "namingExplanation": "Our ministry is named 'Chabod (כָּבוֹד)', from Hebrew, meaning 'Glory'. This name responds to the wandering of the Ark in 1 Samuel — when the Ark of God was captured by the Philistines, the Israelites cried out 'Ichabod', meaning 'The Glory has departed from Israel'. This was a great lament for the loss of God's presence, but in Jesus Christ, we firmly believe: God's glory has never departed (Chabod), He dwells among us, just as He once struck down Dagon, today He still reigns in this digital, AI-rapidly expanding world. Chabod is our declaration: no matter how the world changes, God's glory has never left, still working, still present, and shining His glorious light in every seemingly impossible place.",
